Tennis Insights


Tennis Insights is an application that allows tennis players, coaches, parents to input their playerâ€™s match results to see realtime live scores and stats. Unlike many other match tracking apps out there, Tennis Insights will provide you valuable recommendations that you can use in match to improve your chances of winning. Utilized Monte Carlo methods to design and develop accurate simulations of tennis matches. Additionally, I integrated the application with Google+ API to provide login authentication and allow players to access trends of key stats using matplotlib and numpy. Designed clean and simple user interface while maintaining the complexity of the application. 

Languages: Python
